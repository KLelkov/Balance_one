# Balance_one
The code for uniaxial robot platform for "Robotic Engineering" course


This program relies on following hardware modules:
- L293D motor controller
- IMU sensor array (MPU 6050 compatible)
- SD card module (for recording logs)
- Encoders with interupt operation mode (optical or magnetic)

If you dont need to record logs, you can comment out corresponding code parts.
